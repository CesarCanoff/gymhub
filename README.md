    This app was created with the main aim of offering a learning opportunity in mobile app development using React Native and TypeScript technology. I developed this project as a starting point for exploring the fundamental concepts and best practices of developing on one of the most popular platforms for creating mobile apps, studying Native Base and Bottom Tabs Navigation.

  ```

  3. Install dependencies:
  Use npm to install all the app's dependencies. This may take some time depending on the project's size:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  4. Start the app with Expo:
  After the dependencies are successfully installed, you can start the Gym Hub using Expo Go. Run the following command:
  ```bash
  npx expo start
  ```

  5. Run on Emulator (Linux):
  If you're using Linux and want to run the app on an Android emulator, make sure you have an
  Android emulator like Android Studio's AVD Manager set up. Then, in the Expo DevTools that open in your browser, press "a" to run the app on the Android emulator.

  6. Run on Emulator (Windows):
